# The Status of HTML5 Edit

## Working

- slices are working without splitting an element
- basic cleans are working
- reading and applying selections are working
- wrapping selections is working


## Not Working

- sometimes you will get the error "slice was not applied as expected", which appears to be an issue with leveling, selectionRanges or something else - though it still works


## Next Steps

- see if it works with nowpad
- add more advanced cleaning
- optimise the whole darn thing, it's very ineffecient right now
- add an unwrap button
- get slices and selections working on textareas
