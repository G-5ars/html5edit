# HTML5 Edit

HTML5 Edit is currently in the research and development phase. Its focus is HTML5's contenteditable feature, and goal is to find better ways of interacting with it.


## Trying it Out

HTML5 Edit needs to be running on a server to work

### For Node.js Developers

1. [Install Node.js](https://github.com/balupton/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js)

1. Install [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) and [Simple-Server](https://github.com/balupton/simple-server)

		npm -g install coffee-script simple-server

1. Clone `html5edit`, `cd` into it, and install pre-requisites

	git clone https://github.com/balupton/html5edit.git
	cd html5edit
	npm install
